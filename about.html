        Jake is an actor based in Chicago, Illinois, by way of San Francisco, California. 
        He recently graduated from Northwestern University’s acting program, 
        where he also focused on minoring in psychology, writing fiction, and learning Spanish. 
        Jake will be performing this fall in SF Shakes’ <i>Macbeth</i> (Macduff/Duncan/2nd Witch) –  
        Other recent credits include <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> (Teatro Vista), <i>The Dark at the Top of the Stairs</i>
        (Eclipse Theatre), and <i>Anna in the Tropics, The Grapes of Wrath,</i> and <i>The Little Foxes</i> 
        (Northwestern University).<br><br>
    
        He also has a passion for supporting both new and classical work. He has participated in workshops 
        and staged readings around Chicago such as Christina Anderson’s translation of The Comedy of Errors 
        with Play On! Shakespeare, and as a part of Pegasus Theatre’s Young Playwrights Festival and the 
        Women’s Theatre Alliance’s New Play development series.<br><br>

        Jake spends most of his free time rock climbing, reading, and, when it’s warm, exploring the outside 
        world. This summer he hopes to learn how to fly fish and hike around Illinois.
