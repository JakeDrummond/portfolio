        Jake is an actor based in Chicago, Illinois, by way of San Francisco, California. 
        He recently graduated from Northwestern University’s acting program, where he also focused on minoring in 
        psychology, writing fiction, and learning Spanish. Jake will be performing this spring in Teatro Vista’s 
        <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> (Prince), and has also worked with Eclipse, Greenhouse, 
        and the Women’s Theatre Alliance.<br><br>
        He also has a passion for supporting both new and classical work. He has participated in workshops and 
        staged readings around Chicago such as Christina Anderson’s translation of <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>  
        with Play On! Shakespeare, Sami Ismat’s <i>Ghosts of Freedom</i>, and as a part of Pegasus Theatre’s Young 
        Playwrights Festival. While at Northwestern, Jake had the opportunity to appear in multiple mainstage 
        productions, such as <i>Anna in the Tropics</i> (CheChé) and <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> (Man Going Back).<br><br>
        Jake spends most of his free time rock climbing, reading, and, when it’s warm, exploring the outside world. 
        This summer he hopes to learn how to fly fish and hike Isle Royale National Park.
